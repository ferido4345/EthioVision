                        The kerar is a traditional stringed instrument from Ethiopia, also known as the krar. It is a type of lyre, with a bowl-shaped body and five or six strings that are tuned to a pentatonic scale. The kerar is played by plucking, strumming, or bowing the strings, producing different tones and effects. The kerar is often used to accompany songs of love, praise, and celebration, as well as to express emotions and stories. The kerar is one of the most popular and widespread instruments in the northern regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and it is also played by the Azmari or Wata, who are poet-musicians that travel from place to place, entertaining people with their witty and humorous lyrics.
